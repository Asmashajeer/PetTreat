                    <p>PetTreat began with a simple observation: our pets deserve food as good as what we eat ourselves. Our founder, after struggling to find nutritious options for their rescue dog with dietary sensitivities, decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>
                    <p>What started as a small online shop has grown into a trusted source of premium nutrition for pets across the country. Today, we work directly with trusted suppliers and nutritionists to create and curate food options that help pets thrive.</p>
                    <p>Despite our growth, we've maintained our core values of quality, transparency, and pet wellness above all else. Every product on our virtual shelves has been carefully selected with your pet's health and happiness in mind.</p>
